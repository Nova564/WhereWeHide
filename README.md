# Little Nightmares Like – Prototype

## Overview
Puzzle / reflection game set in a **dark, fantastic and horror-inspired universe**.  
The player controls a small character trying to escape a hostile environment by solving puzzles while avoiding deadly enemies.

This project is a **playable prototype developed in 5 days** using **Unity (C#)**, inspired by *Little Nightmares*.

- Genre: Puzzle / Reflection
- Mode: Single-player
- Platform: PC (Keyboard & Controller)

## Inspirations
- Little Nightmares
- Environmental storytelling games
- Stealth and observation-based gameplay

## Core Gameplay Loop
Discover a room  
→ Observe the environment  
→ Understand the puzzle  
→ Avoid the monster  
→ Exit the room  

The player is intentionally **very small compared to enemies and the environment**, reinforcing vulnerability.

## Player Mechanics
The player can:
- Walk
- Run
- Crouch
- Jump
- Climb on furniture
- Climb ropes
- Push objects
- Collect quest items

The player must:
- Solve puzzles
- Avoid being killed by enemies
- Stay hidden and move quietly
- Progress from room to room

## NPCs
Small NPCs of the same size as the player:
- Dialogue interactions
- Provide lore
- Give warnings
- Help the player understand certain mechanics

## Enemies
- Invincible enemies
- Visual detection
- Sound-based detection (falling objects, movement noise)
- Enemies move toward the source of detected sounds

## Atmosphere
Due to time constraints and limited experience, the atmosphere is intentionally **less intense and oppressive than Little Nightmares**:
- Focus on gameplay and mechanics
- Priority given to functionality
- Goal: a fun and playable prototype

## Project Status
- Playable prototype
- Single level
- Multiple functional puzzles
- Basic enemy AI
- Possible improvements: AI behavior, sound design, atmosphere, level design polish
